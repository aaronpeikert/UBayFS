# Statement of Need

The $\mathtt{R}$ package UBayFS implements the user-guided framework for feature selection, proposed in @jenul2022ubayfs, which incorporates information from the data and prior knowledge from domain experts. With its generic setup, UBayFS shows flexibility to specify side constraints, which exceeds the capabilities of conventional feature selectors. Beyond the option to specify a maximum number of features, the user can add must-link constraints (features must be selected together) or cannot-link constraints (features must not be selected together). In addition, must-link constraints can be used for block feature selection (a problem conventionally tackled by group lasso, see @sgl). Using relaxed constraints, a parameter $\rho$ regulates the penalty shape. Hence, the violation of constraints can be valid but leads to penalizing a feature set. State-of-the-art methods do not cover such scenarios. In summary, UBayFS has the potential to
cover both expert knowledge and information from an ensemble of elementary feature selectors jointly in a Bayesian framework, as well as
consider constraints to the feature set as side conditions during optimization. The framework is demonstrated in \autoref{fig:UBayFS}.
The presented $\mathtt{R}$ package UBayFS provides an implementation along with an interactive Shiny dashboard, which makes feature selection applicable for $\mathtt{R}$-users with different levels of expertise. The implementation allows the user to choose from multiple state-of-the-art feature selectors for building the generic ensemble of UBayFS. The current choice includes:

- Laplacian score
- Fisher score
- mRMR
- Lasso
- decision tree
- recursive feature elimination
- HSIC Lasso

Prior weights can be specified for single features or whole blocks as weight vectors. Linear side constraints are implemented straightforwardly via a matrix $A$ and a right side $b$ or with a customized function for specific constraint types. Hence, the sophisticated statistical model is summarized in a user-friendly and easy-to-use package.


![At first, UbayFS elaborates information directly from data via ensemble feature selection. This information is merged with prior expert knowledge (a-priori feature weights) in a Bayesian model framework. Additionally, the user can include further side constraints such as a maximum number of features or cannot-link constraints between features. The final step is the optimization with respect to the model's utility function including the side constraints.\label{fig:UBayFS}](UBayFS_concept.png)

# Concept of UBayFS

As described in @jenul2022ubayfs, UBayFS is a Bayesian ensemble feature selector. The methodology is based on quantifying two random variables: $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, representing feature importances, and $\boldsymbol{y}$, representing evidence collected from the data, which is collected from a generic ensemble of elementary feature selection models. Statistically, we interpret the result from each elementary feature selector as realization from a multinomial distribution with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, where $\boldsymbol{\theta}\in[0,1]^N$ defines the success probabilities of sampling each feature in an individual feature selection and thus the success probability in the ensemble. Both sources of information are combined using Bayes' Theorem:

$$p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\boldsymbol{y})\propto p(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{\theta})\cdot p(\boldsymbol{\theta}).$$

In the framework of UBayFS,  $p(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{\theta})$ represents the data-driven component (implemented via a multinomial likelihood) while $p(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ describes the user knowledge part modeled with a Dirichlet distribution. Due to the conjugate prior property of the Dirichlet distribution, the posterior parameter update has a tractable form and can be computed analytically.  Side constraints are represented by a system of linear inequalities $\boldsymbol{A}\cdot \boldsymbol{\delta}-\boldsymbol{b}\leq 0$, where $\boldsymbol{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\times N}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}\in\mathbb{R}^K$. $K$ is defined as the total number of constraints. 

In UBayFS, a relaxed inadmissibility function $\kappa_{k,\rho}(\boldsymbol{\delta})$ is used as a penalization for the violation of the given side constraints, where

$$
\kappa_{k,\rho}(\boldsymbol{\delta}) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{l l}
    0 & \text{if}~\left(\boldsymbol{a}^{(k)}\right)^T\boldsymbol{\delta}\leq b^{(k)}\\
    1 & \text{if}~ \left(\boldsymbol{a}^{(k)}\right)^T\boldsymbol{\delta}> b^{(k)} \land \rho =\infty\\
    \frac{1-\xi_{k,\rho}}{1 + \xi_{k,\rho}} & \text{otherwise},
    \end{array}
    \right.
$$
    
where $\rho\in\mathbb{R}^+ \cup {\infty}$ denotes a relaxation parameter and
$\xi_{k,\rho} = \exp\left(-\rho \left(\left( \boldsymbol{a}^{(k)}\right)^T\boldsymbol{\delta} - b^{(k)}\right)\right)$ defines the exponential term of a logistic function. To handle $K$ different constraints for one feature selection problem, the joint admissibility function is given as

$$ \kappa(\boldsymbol{\delta})
    = 1 - \prod\limits_{k=1}^{K} \left(1 -\kappa_{k,\rho}(\boldsymbol{\delta})\right)$$

which originates from the idea that $\kappa = 1$ (maximum penalization) if at least one $\kappa_{k,\rho}=1$, while $\kappa=0$ (no penalization) if all $\kappa_{k,\rho}=0$. 

The target function to select an optimal feature set $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ is given by an expected utility given the posterior parameter $\boldsymbol{\delta} | \boldsymbol{y}$, as well as the inadmissibility function $\kappa(.)$.

$$\mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}|\boldsymbol{y}}[U(\boldsymbol{\delta}, \boldsymbol{\theta}(\boldsymbol{y}))] = \boldsymbol{\delta}^T \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}|\boldsymbol{y}}[\boldsymbol{\theta}(\boldsymbol{y} )]-\lambda\kappa(\boldsymbol{\delta})\longrightarrow \underset{\boldsymbol{\delta}\in\{0,1\}^N}{\text{max}}
$$

The optimization is implemented via a genetic algorithm (see @ida:fSparseGlasso) along with a Greedy algorithm for initialization, suggested in @jenul2022ubayfs, to find a proper start vector for the optimization.

# Package Summary
The function `build.UBaymodel()` initializes a UBayFS S3 class object Ubaymodel and computes the ensemble of elementary feature selectors. In the current version, among others, linear feature selectors such as Fisher and Laplacian scores from `Rdimtools` [@you2022rdimtools], mrmr `mRMRe` [@de2013mrmre] or the non-linear HSIC Lasso are supported as options [@gselection]. In addition, the number of elementary models $M$ and the number of features selected in the elementary feature selectors are specified. The user can directly set prior weights inside the `build` function. Constraints are either provided as a matrix $A$ and a right side $b$, or built using the `buildConstraints()` function, which supports max-size, must-link and cannot-link constraints on both feature and block levels. UBayFS requires at least one constraint limiting the total number of features to be selected ("max-size"). The level of constraint-relaxation is steered with an input parameter $\rho$. The weights for single features or feature blocks are set with `setWeights()`.

The functions `admissibility()` and `block_admissibility()` allow the user to evaluate the penalty term for a given feature set under a given set of constraints. After initializing the model and computing the ensembles, the `train.UBaymodel()` function optimizes the feature set via a genetic algorithm [@scrucca2013ga] together with a greedy feature-set initialization, such that an optimal feature set can be returned. According to empirical evaluations, the greedy initialization decreases the runtime and leads to faster convergence towards an optimal feature set.  Finally, the package features generic functions `print.UBaymodel()`, `plot.UBaymodel()`, `evaluateFS()` and `summary.UBaymodel()` as well as an evaluation function `evaluteFS()` to report and visualize results. Two vignettes guide the user through the package and demonstrate how the method can be deployed in common application scenarios, including how user knowledge is specified and how feature- and block-wise constraints are set.

# Interactive Shiny Dashboard
 The function `runInteractive()` opens an interactive Shiny dashboard allowing the user to load and interactively analyze data. However, due to computational limitations, it is not recommended to use the HTML interface for larger datasets ($> 50$ features or $>1000$ samples). Instead, functions should be called from the $\mathtt{R}$ console in such cases. \autoref{fig:Shiny} shows the dashboard with the different tabs:

 - **data**: Load the dataset and specify whether row names, column names, or a block structure is present. A demo dataset is ready to be loaded and used for a first touch on the package.
 - **likelihood**: Select elementary feature selectors for ensemble feature selection, the number of models $M$, the number of features in each model and the ratio of the train-test split. Further, the dashboard allows the user to mix different elementary feature selectors, although this option is not recommended due to limited stability [@seijo:ensembleSurvey].
 - **weights**: The prior feature weights set by the user. For block feature selection, it is possible to set weights for blocks; otherwise, for a single feature.
 - **constraints**: In this task, the user sets different constraints (at least a max-size constraint). The penalty $\rho$ can be varied here as well.
 - **feature selection**: In the dashboard's last step, the feature set's optimization takes place. A plot of the final result is produced - also, the model can be saved as an Rdata file and loaded to the dashboard again.

# Ongoing research
Based on the present UBayFS package, ongoing work focuses on the implementation of even more types of expert constraints and elementary feature selection models. Moreover, a Python package with similar functionality is planned for the future.
